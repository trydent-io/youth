# Youth - Uth Management System

A simple project developed for learning new stuff about Kotlin, Vue.js and Jooby Framework.

## Some instructions

So far there ain't complete deployment phase, so take it as-is.

The project has been split in two modules:
1. `youth-webapp`: Kotlin and Jooby sub-project
2. `youth-webui`: NodeJS and Vue.js sub-project

For `youth-webapp` you just need Maven 3.3+ and an IDE (or a terminal if you wish) and make it run on `port 8080`.

For `youth-webui` you need to spend a little more time:
1. install NodeJS
2. `npm install -g vue-cli vue`
3. enter in `youth-webui` folder and just `npm install`
4. finally `npm run dev`

The WebUI should be shown on `port 8090`.
